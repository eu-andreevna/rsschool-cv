### **About me**

I'm a fourth year student at the Moscow Aviation Institute. My specialization is computer science. I like my specialization. I decided to link my future work with programming because I liked this when I was studying in school.

I've tried to create sites on platform "Tilda". But after a while I understood that it does not bring much pleasure. I don't like process of finding a client. I had to send a lot of messages to different people. And often they didn't answer me.

When I was in my thrid year, I learned about frontend development and wanted to learn it. I have completed course the Stage#0 in the RS School and I'm going to have completed the Stage#1 and the Stage#2. I like to write code and watch the pages change, make elements interactive. I like to see how html and css do page is beautiful and interesting. More I always interesting to study new chips.

Besides, I like to play volleyball, do sports, read books. I was playing volleyball for 6 year when I was studying in school.

### **Code example:**

KATA with CodeWars

Write a function toWeirdCase (weirdcase in Ruby) that accepts a string, and returns the same string with all even indexed characters in each word upper cased, and all odd indexed characters in each word lower cased. The indexing just explained is zero based, so the zero-ith index is even, therefore that character should be upper cased and you need to start over for each word.

The passed in string will only consist of alphabetical characters and spaces(' '). Spaces will only be present if there are multiple words. Words will be separated by a single space(' ').

```
function toWeirdCase(string){
  string = string.split(' ');

  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    string[i] = string[i].split('').map((symbol, index) => {
      return index % 2 === 0 ? symbol.toUpperCase() : symbol.toLowerCase();
    }).join('');
  }

  return string.join(' ')
}

```
