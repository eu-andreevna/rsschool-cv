### **About me**

I'm a fourth year student at the Moscow Aviation Institute. My specialization is computer science. I like my specialization. I decided to link my future work with programming because I liked this when I was studying in school.

I've tried to create sites on platform "Tilda". But after a while I understood that it does not bring much pleasure. I don't like process of finding a client. I had to send a lot of messages to different people. And often they didn't answer me.

When I was in my thrid year, I learned about frontend development and wanted to learn it. I have completed course the Stage#0 in the RS School and I'm going to have completed the Stage#1 and the Stage#2. I like to write code and watch the pages change, make elements interactive. I like to see how html and css do page is beautiful and interesting. More I always interesting to study new chips.

Besides, I like to play volleyball, do sports, read books. I was playing volleyball for 6 year when I was studying in school.
